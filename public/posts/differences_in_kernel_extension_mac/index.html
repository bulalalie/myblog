<p>Create drivers, system extensions, and kernel extensions for specific low-level system services.</p>
<ul>
<li>A DriverKit extension (dext) manages the communication between your company&rsquo;s hardware device and the rest of the system.</li>
<li>A system extension implements features that require kernel-level cooperation, such as custom security and network behaviors.</li>
<li>A kernel extension (kext) supports any low-level services that cannot be implemented using a dext or system extension.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../img/972d5747-18f1-4f93-bced-36af28eeb872.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The System Extensions framework supports a class of kernel-level features that previously required kexts. System extensions run in user space and interact with the kernel to perform specific tasks. For example, an endpoint-security system extension monitors system events for potential security threats.</p>
<p>In macOS 11 and later, the kernel doesn&rsquo;t load a kext if an equivalent System Extension solution exists. You may continue to use kexts in macOS 10.15 and earlier.</p>
